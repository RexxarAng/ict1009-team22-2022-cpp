## Introduction
The Movie Booking System application mimics ones used in cinemas. It aims to achieve the browsing of movies currently showing under the movie catalog, as well as the showtimes and its hall seating. Additionally, there must be a booking feature where the user (cinema usher) is able to book the movie tickets for the customers. Lastly, there must be an admin menu to facilitate administrative functionalities such as adding a new movie or removing showtimes. Therefore, the Chaw Movie Booking System must be able to store and load data between the system and storage.

##Setup
To run this project, run the executable directly:

```
$ ./ict1009-team22-2022.cpp.exe
```

Alternatively, install Visual Studio 2022 and run the solution directly.
